Project 1

COP 4600 
Spring 2017

Due: Feb 4 (patch file, code, report on Canvas)
Demo by signup on Doodle poll (see Canvas).

Brief Description:
Implement a new system call in Minix 3.2.1, along with two library functions 
in the system library that allow it to be called from a C program. 
We will provide a C program that exercises and demonstrates the new call. 
Demonstrate the system call by building your modified Minix 3 with the new
system call, compiling our demo program, then running the demo program on your 
modified Minix 3 for the TA during the slot that you reserved. 
Be prepared to discuss what you did, what problems you faced, how you solved
them, what files you modified, and what you learned. 

Details of System Call:
You will first modify the process table to include a new integer value, 
tag, initialized to zero.  
The new system call will allow 
(a) the value of tag to be read by the process or a process with root access, 
(b) the value of tag to be written by a process with root access
Comment: The tag will later be used in access control.

Library procedures:
You will also implement library procedures that can be referenced by 
a C program to demonstrate the call. These must be included in the system
library so that compiling a C program that references them will work (i.e., 
the references to these calls will be resolved). 

The library procedures will have prototypes
int set_tag(int PID, int newvalue);
int get_tag(int PID); 
Both will return the value of tag, or an error number (negative). 

The argument PID will be the process ID of the process whose tag is to be 
accessed, and newvalue will be the new value of the non-negative tag. 
A successful call to get_tag(P) that immediately follows a successful call 
to set_tag(P,v) shall return the value v (i.e., the set_tag call shall 
change the value of tag for process P to v, which shall be returned when
get_tag is called). 

Both the get_tag() and the set_tag() call shall fail if the process ID 
refers to an invalid PID (either out of bounds or a process table entry 
that is not in use); the PID must refer to a live process (in any state). 

The set_tag() call shall also fail if the value is negative. 

Failure shall be indicated by a return value of -1.

Test program:
We will supply a simple test program, but you may want to implement your
own program(s) for testing. 
Our test program must compile using the system library after you have
modified your Minix VM. 

Documentation:
You will provide the following two documents. 

man page - a manual page for your library procedures in man page format 
(you may copy and modify an existing man page for this purpose). You must
place the new man page in the proper location so that entering the command
man set_tag or man get_tag return the man page for these calls. 

Report (may be pdf, doc, docx, or txt) - this document will explain how you 
implemented the new system call, including what changes were made to which 
files and why each change was made.  It will include description of how 
testing was performed along with any known bugs.

Submission:
You will submit 
- a patch file including all the changes made from a fresh installation 
of Minix 3.2.1 to existing Minix files needed to support the new call 
(note that this includes any changes to makefiles also)
- all new source files you created, along with the test files and makefile
- man page
- report

Applying the patches and remaking the necessary parts of Minix, then
rebooting and typing "make test" in the directory with the test code
should compile the test program and link in the new library object code. 

Demonstration:
You will sign up to demonstrate your code to a TA on the Doodle poll we will
set up and make available on Canvas.  You will have 10 minutes to demo and to 
answer questions.  Do not be late for your demo. Missed demo appointments will 
deduct 3 points from your score for each missed appointment (late is defined 
as 1 or more minutes late). 

Helpful resources:
The Minix3.org website has many helpful documents, and we will add documents 
to the class website of a more specific nature.
